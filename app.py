# Voting web application
#
# This Flask app implements a simple multiâ€‘round elimination voting system. It
# allows regular users to select exactly three names to vote out. Votes are
# recorded per day (three days in total) and only one ballot per browser per
# round is permitted (enforced via a cookie). An admin area secured by a
# password enables management tasks such as adding or removing contestants,
# resetting the current round (which archives the top five results and
# advances to the next day) and viewing historical standings.
#
# Styling lives in ``static/css/style.css`` and uses the colour palette
# requested by the user: a vivid orange (#ff5300) accent on a dark grey
# background with white text. Templates are kept under the ``templates/``
# directory and extend a common base layout.

# Define a simple admin password for demonstration purposes. In a real
# deployment this should be stored securely (e.g. environment variable) and
# hashed.
